## WHY? 
Vector space word representations capture syntactic and semantic regularities in language well. 

## WHAT?
To test how continuous word representation capture regularities, this paper introduce relation-specific vector offset method. All the analogy tasks can be formulated as "a is to b as c is to __". Synthetic test asks gramatical regularities such as base-comparative or singular-plural. Symantic test asks semantic regularities like "clothing is to shirt as dis is to bowl".

To answer analogy question, vector offset method can be used to find the answer.

$$
y = x_b - x_a + x_c\\
w* = argmax_w\frac{x_w y}{\|x_w\|\|y\|}
$$

## So?
RNNLM performed best in word analogy task. 

## Critic
Symantic test can be subjective.
