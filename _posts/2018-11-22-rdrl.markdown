## WHY? 
Relational information is important in some reinforcement learning tasks.

## WHAT?
![image](/assets/images/rdrl.png){: .center-image width="50px"}
Relational information can be important source for high scores in reinforcement learning. To provide inductive bias for relational information, this paper appied self-attention(MHDPA) to the last layer of the convolution network that encode the state. Another multilayer perceptron($$f_\theta$$) is applied in parallel to each self-attended objects. 

## So?
The agent achieved state-of-the-art result in Box-World and StarCrat2 Minigame.

## Critic
Good inductive bias for relational information which is useful for agent.
