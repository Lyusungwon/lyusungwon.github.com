## WHY? 
[Neural modular networks]() do not generalize well to new questions since their performance rely on syntactic parser. 

## WHAT?
![image](/assets/images/iep1.png){: .center-image width="50px"}

Instead of parsing questions into universal dependency representation, this paper used LSTM to generate a sequence of functions to form a program. Function modules are generic: unary module, binary module and scene module. The program generator is trained in semi-supervised manner. First it is trained with few ground truth labels and fine tuned with REINFORCE algorithm. 

## So?

Stongly supervised model whoed near-perfect performance on CLEVR, and semi-supervised model showed better performance than any other baselines.

This program showed to attend the right place of the image.
