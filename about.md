Welcome! My name is Sungwon Lyu and this is my personal blog for my study and hobby. I'm very interested in overall deep learning and trying to summarize the deep learning papers I read as reminders for myself. I also love books, movies and swimming. My publications, presentations and personal projects can be found in [here](https://lyusungwon.github.io/archive/).
Any share of ideas, contacts, comments, criticisms, and questions are welcome through email(lyusungwon@dm.snu.ac.kr).
